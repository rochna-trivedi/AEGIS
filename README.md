## 📖 Abstract

The management of modern database systems is increasingly complex, demanding significant manual effort for optimization, security, and maintenance. **AEGIS** is a novel framework built on a decentralized multi-agent architecture. It distributes core management tasks among a team of specialized, collaborative agents to create a self-driving, self-securing, and self-repairing database ecosystem.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

AEGIS consists of specialized intelligent agents that collaborate to manage the database:

1.  **Interaction Agent (Implemented):** Translates natural language user questions into SQL queries and returns results.
2.  **Analyst Agent (In Progress):** Monitors query patterns and establishes performance baselines.
3.  **Performance Agent:** Proactively creates indexes and optimizes slow queries.
4.  **Security Agent:** Detects SQL injection and anomalous access patterns.
5.  **Data Quality Agent:** Identifies and cleans inconsistent or duplicate data.
